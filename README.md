I'm Luca, and I'm currently a MSc Student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. My research interests revolve around graph algorithms and representational learning 🌐, but I am also interested in recommender systems 🎯, reinforcement learning 🕹️, generative modelling 🪸 and AI4Sicence 🧬.
