### Hi there 👋 

I'm Luca, and I'm currently a MSc Student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. My research interests revolve around graph algorithms and representational learning 🌐, but I am also interested in recommender systems 🎯, reinforcement learning 🕹️, generative modelling 🪸 and AI4Sicence 🧬.

! I hold a bachelor’s in Computer
Science and Engineering from TU Delft since last year, and I had the chance
to work with graph algorithms and node representational learning as part of
the FACT course earlier this year. I am particularly interested in delving into a
more in-depth study of how geometric information and reasoning (as seen in We-
isfeiler and Lehman Go Topological/Cellular) can be combined with structural
information in order to improve the expressive power of standard MPNNs. I am
equally excited to get my hands dirty with the implementation details of these
techniques and experiment with different datasets to evaluate their effectiveness.
